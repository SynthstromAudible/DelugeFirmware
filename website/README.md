## Contributing

Click the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of the page you wish to edit.
If you add new files to the docs folders, they will show up in the sidebar automatically.

For the basics on how to write documentation, check the Starlight documentation page on
[Authoring Content in Markdown](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/)!
Even if you are a seasoned markdown veteran, this page is a must-read so that you are aware of
the cool extensions that Starlight has.

Always use absolute paths for linking to other pages, the link validator will yell at you otherwise.
E.g. `[Features Overview](/features/community_features)`

Always use relative paths for images.
Feel free to place images into a folder next to the documentation page that uses them.
E.g. `![My Photo](../photo.jpg)`.
The `/src/assets` folder can be used for more general use assets.

Write in .md or .mdx format instead of Markdoc wherever possible, for consistency.

## Testing

Make sure that you have the [bun](https://bun.sh/) tool installed on your system.

Run `bun install` and then `bun dev` in the terminal.
Open http://localhost:4321 in your browser.
The page will automatically refresh with the changes you make.

This project is set up so that it can correctly deploy to the GitHub Pages site of a fork.
Use this if you'd like to deploy a change to show to others.

## Links

You most likely don't have to worry about the [base path](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base), but if a link is not working on a fork
then this is probably the reason.

Links in markdown (md, mdx) files automatically have the base path added.
So if your home page is available at `/DelugeFirmware`,
the link from the above example would be converted to
`/DelugeFirmware/features/community_features` automatically during the build.

If you have links in a file that is not markdown, you need to use the [withBase](src/utils.ts)
utility function to ensure correct links are generated in all cases.
See [index.astro](src/pages/index.astro) for an example usage.

## [Doxygen](https://delugecommunity.com/doxygen)

The [deploy-website.yml](../.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml) workflow deploys both the Starlight website and the developer documentation generated by Doxygen.

The Doxygen output gets copied to `/website/public/doxygen`, so don't put anything there.
Likewise, don't put anything behind the `/doxygen` URL path within Starlight to avoid a collision.

Starlight docs are great, don't forget to use them!

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── docs/
│   └── content.config.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
