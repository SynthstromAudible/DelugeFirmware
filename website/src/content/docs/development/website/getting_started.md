This page provides guidelines for contributing to the development of the official Deluge Community Firmware website, including adding content to existing website pages, and adding new pages.

## Contributing

You'll find an "Edit page" link at the bottom of each documentation page. Click this link to open the github.dev editor in your browser, where you can make changes to the documentation source files.

For more info, check the [github.dev editor documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor)!

For the basics on how to write documentation, check the Starlight documentation page on
[Authoring Content in Markdown](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/)!
Even if you are a seasoned Markdown veteran, this page is a must-read so that you are aware of
the cool extensions that Starlight has.

If you add new files to the docs folders, they will show up in the sidebar automatically.

Always use absolute paths for linking to other pages, the link validator will yell at you otherwise.
E.g. `[Features Overview](/features/community_features)`

Always use relative paths for referencing images.
Feel free to place images into a folder next to the documentation page that uses them.
E.g. `![My Photo](../photo.jpg)`.
The `/src/assets` folder can be used for more general use assets.

Write in `.md` or `.mdx` format. `.md` files are "pure" Markdown but with directives added. For example `:key[...]` can be used to reference Deluge shortcuts. `.mdx` files do everything that Markdown files can, but can also include Components. See the [Starlight docs](https://starlight.astro.build/components/using-components/) for more information.

## Testing your changes

### Using GitHub Pages on your fork

1. In your fork of the DelugeFirmware repository, go to the `Actions` tab.
2. Select the `Deploy to GitHub Pages` workflow.
3. Click `Run workflow` on the right
4. Select the branch you want to deploy
5. Click `Run`
6. Check https://your-github-username.github.io/DelugeFirmware/ to see your deployed website.

### On your machine

Make sure that you have [bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your system. You can check by running `bun -v` in your terminal.

If the `bun` command is not recognized by your terminal after a successful installation and restarting the terminal, follow these steps to add it manually to your system PATH: [How to add bun to your PATH](https://bun.sh/docs/installation#how-to-add-your-path)

If `bun` has been successfully installed, you can go to the `website` folder in your terminal (by running `cd website`) and run `bun install` and then `bun dev`.
Once the dev server has started, you can open `http://localhost:4321` in your browser.
The page will automatically refresh with the changes you make.

## Links

You most likely don't have to worry about the [base path](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#base), but if a link is not working on a fork,
then this is probably the reason.

Links in Markdown (md, mdx) files automatically have the base path added.
So if your home page is available at `/DelugeFirmware`,
the link from the above example would be converted to
`/DelugeFirmware/features/community_features` automatically during the build.

If you have links in a file that is not Markdown, you need to use the `src/utils.ts`
utility function to ensure correct links are generated in all cases.
See `src/pages/index.astro` for an example usage.

## [Doxygen](https://delugecommunity.com/doxygen)

The `../.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml` workflow deploys both the Starlight website and the developer documentation generated by Doxygen.

The Doxygen output gets copied to `/website/public/doxygen`, so don't put anything there.
Likewise, don't put anything behind the `/doxygen` URL path within Starlight to avoid a collision.

Starlight docs are great, don't forget to use them!

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── docs/
│   └── content.config.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command               | Action                                           |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `bun install`         | Installs dependencies                            |
| `bun dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `bun build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `bun preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `bun astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `bun astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## Troubleshooting

### bun dev command doesn't work

Run the following command: `bun astro dev`

### error is displayed saying to run "npx playwright install"

The site uses playwright for generating the site previews and the mermaid diagrams.

To install playwright, run the following command: `bun playwright install --with-deps chromium`
