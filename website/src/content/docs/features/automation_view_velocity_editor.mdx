Note Velocity Editing View that has been added as part of the existing Automation View implementation so that you can edit the velocities and other parameters of notes in a single note row.

## Description

- imagine if the whole grid was just one note row, or one kit row
- each column of colours represents a note
- the vertical colours represents that notes velocity which you can edit by interacting with the grid (like you would with a parameter in automation view)

## Quick Overview

### Enter the Velocity Editor View

- While in the Automation Instrument Clip View, use Shift + Velocity or press Velocity pad on Automation Overview to enter the Velocity Note Editor
  OR
- While in the Instrument Clip View, hold Audition pad + Press Velocity shortcut pad

### Select note row

- Press audition pad or Vertical scroll to select different note rows
- The audition pad will blink to indicate the currently selected note row
- The display will indicate the note code / drum name of the row you have selected

### Add Note / Adjust Velocity Using Grid

- Press grid to set/adjust velocities of existing notes and add note (if no note exists)
- Set a Velocity Ramp:
  - Press and hold two grid note pads to set a velocity ramp between the two notes.
  - Note: for this to work, you must first press a pad that has a note in it and then press a second pad that has a note in it. if the second pad has no note already in it, it will set a tail instead for the first note pad pressed (or if it's a drum sound, like a kick, it will just add another note in the position of the second pad press).

### Remove Note

- Short press top velocity pad in a note column to remove note

### Select Note and Adjust Note Parameters

- Long press top velocity pad in a note column to see note's velocity and perform note related adjustment actions (e.g. adjust velocity, probability). Note press related actions include:
  - **Adjust Velocity:** :key[turn Horizontal]
  - **Adjust Probability:** :key[turn Select]
  - **Adjust Note Repeat:** :key[press turn Vertical]
  - **Adjust Automation:** :key[turn Gold]

### Adjust Note Row Transpose

- Press and turn vertical encoder
- Note: does not work if you are holding a note (transpose gets replaced with editing note repeats)

### Adjust Note Row Probability

- Hold Audition Pad + Turn Select Encoder to change the selected Note Row's probability
  - Note: does not work if you are currently holding a note

### Add/Remove Notes with Euclidean

- Hold Audition Pad + Press and turn vertical encoder
- Note: The Euclidean action is replaced by note repeat editing if you have selected a note (either by holding a note outside pad selection mode or if you are in pad selection mode)

### Change clip length

- :key[Shift + turn Horizontal]

### Change selected note row length

- :key[Audition Pad + turn Horizontal]
- Note: does not work if you have selected a note

### Clear notes in selected note row

- :key[Horizontal + Back]
- Note: does not work if you have selected a note

### Rotate Note Row

- :key[Vertical + turn Horizontal]
- :key[Audition Pad + press turn Horizontal]
- Note: does not work if you have selected a note

### Quantize / Humanize notes

- Enabling Quantize community feature
- Hold audition pad + press and turn tempo encoder to set quantize / humanize %

### Cross Screen Editing

- Press cross screen while in the Velocity Note Editor to edit notes across multiple screens.
- Note: you can only toggle cross screen editing if the clip has multiple screens OR the current note row selected has multiple screens.
