## Description

Each column represents a different "FX" and each pad/row in the column corresponds to a different FX value.

Specifications:

- Perform FX menu to edit Song level parameters and enable/disable editing mode.
- 16 FX columns
  - 1 Param assigned to each column
- 8 FX values per column
  - Long press :key[PAD PADS] (>= 100ms by default) in a column to change the value momentarily and reset it (to the value before the pad was pressed) upon pad release
  - Short press :key[PAD PADS] (< 100ms by default) in a column to change the value until you press the pad again (resetting it to the value before the pad was pressed)
  - Quickly clear all held values by pressing :key[HORIZONTAL + BACK] (resetting FX values back to their previous state)
- Editing mode to edit the FX values assigned to each pad and the parameter assigned to each FX column
- Save defaults as `PerformanceView.xml` file
  - Adjustable default Values assigned to each FX column via `VALUE` editing mode or `PerformanceView.xml`
  - Adjustable default Param assigned to each FX column via `PARAM` editing mode or `PerformanceView.xml`
  - Adjustable default "held pad" settings for each FX column via Performance View or `PerformanceView.xml` (simply change a held pad in Performance View and save the layout to save the layout with the held pads).
- Load defaults from `PerformanceView.xml` file

## Usage

#### 1) Enter performance view from song / arranger views by pressing :key[KEYBOARD].

#### 2) Short press (< 100ms by default) a :key[PAD] in the columns to hold that pad's value (parameter and held value is displayed on the screen)

- Note: If you save the layout while pad's are in a "held" state, the next time you re-load that layout it will re-load the held pad's and change the associated parameter's value based on the previous held state.

#### 3) Long press (>= 100ms by default) a :key[PAD] in the columns to play the FX but not hold it (when you let go of the pad it will snap back to previous value).

- Note: The long press / short press time used for Performance View can be configured in the global settings menu under `DEFAULTS` as `HOLD PRESS TIME`.

#### 4) Press :key[HORIZONTAL + BACK] to clear all "held" FX values.

#### 5) You can edit the default values for each pad in the Performance View by entering a `VALUE EDITING MODE`. Here are the instructions for Value Editing mode:

> Enter using :key[Shift + Keyboard] button

or

> Enter using the menu
>
> - Enter `VALUE EDITING MODE` by pressing :key[SELECT] to open up the Perform FX Menu
> - In the Perform FX menu, select the `EDITING MODE` sub menu and press down on Select Encoder to enter the menu
> - Change Editing Mode to `VALUE` and press :key[SELECT] to enter `VALUE EDITING MODE`

At any time you can Exit out of `VALUE EDITING MODE` using the :key[Back] button

Value Editing Mode:

- While in the Value Editor, pressing any :key[PAD] on the grid will display the current value assigned to that pad.
- You can edit that pad's value by turning the select encoder while selecting a single pad (so it's highlighted white) or holding down on that pad. The updated value will be reflected on the display. So either :key[pad > turn select] or :key[pad + turn select].
- After you have edited a value, the :key[Save] button will start flashing to indicate that you have "Unsaved" changes. :key[save + keyboard] to save your changes. Once saved, the :key[Save] button will stop blinking. To avoid being distracting, the :key[Save] button will only blink when you are in editing mode. If you exit editing mode it will stop blinking and if you re-enter editing mode it will blink again to remind you that you have unsaved changes.
- You can re-load saved changes using :key[load + keyboard]. This will cause you to lose unsaved changes and the :key[Save] button will stop blinking.
- Defaults are saved in an XML file on your SD card called `PerformanceView.XML` - deleting this file will cause the PerformanceView to revert back to its regular default values for each pad.
- Once you are done with editing mode, press :key[Back] to exit out to either the `EDITING MODE` sub menu or `PERFORMANCE VIEW` (depending on how you entered the `VALUE EDITING MODE`)

#### 6) You can edit the Parameter assigned to each FX column by entering a `PARAM` Editing Mode. Here are the instructions for Param Editing mode:

> Enter using :key[SHIFT + KEYBOARD] button. You will need to cycle passed the Value Editing Mode to enter the Param Editing Mode.

or

> Enter using the menu
>
> - Enter `PARAM EDITING MODE` by pressing down on the :key[SELECT] to open up the Perform FX Menu
> - In the Perform FX menu, select the `EDITING MODE` sub menu and press down on Select Encoder to enter the menu
> - Change Editing Mode to `PARAM`

At any time you can Exit out of `VALUE EDITING MODE` using the :key[Back] button

Param Editing Mode:

- Param Editing Mode will show you an overview of the parameters that are assignable to the FX columns in Performance View by lighting dimly the shortcut pads for these parameters.
- Parameters that have been assigned to one or more columns will have their shortcut pads lit up bright white.
- Press on a shortcut pad to illuminate the FX columns that that parameter has been assigned to.
- While holding a shortcut pad, press on the FX columns to assign or unassign a parameter to/from a column.
- Press :key[HORIZONTAL + BACK] to clear all existing Parameter assignments.
- When a Parameter has not been assigned to a column, that column will not be lit and will be unusable in Performance View until you assign a Parameter. This applies to editing the values for that FX column as well (assign a Parameter first, then you can edit the values).
- Parameters are saved to `PerformanceView.xml`. You can manually edit the Parameters in the xml as well, but you must use the exact Parameter names. It is recommended to save a fresh `PerformanceView.xml` and back it up so you have a record of the Parameter Names.
- Once you are done with editing mode, press :key[BACK] to exit out to either the `EDITING MODE` sub menu or `PERFORMANCE VIEW` (depending on how you entered the `PARAM EDITING MODE`)

#### 7) You can Undo/Redo your changes in Performance View

## Default FX and Colour Assignments

- The default Param and Colour Assignments for each FX column in Performance View are as follows
- Note: if you re-arrange the parameters to different FX columns (e.g. using Param Editing Mode), they will bring the colours noted below with them.
