The Visualizer feature provides real-time audio visualizations on the OLED display, showing different representations of the audio signal. The visualizer replaces the VU meter display when active and provides visual feedback for your audio output. It includes both global mix visualization and clip-specific visualization for individual instrument clips.

## Enabling the Visualizer

The visualizer must first be enabled in the Community Settings menu:

1. Press the :key[Shift + Select] button to open the Settings menu
2. Navigate to `COMMUNITY FEATURES`
3. Select `VISUALIZER`
4. Choose a visualizer mode other than OFF:

Visualizers Available:

- `WAVEFORM` - Shows audio waveform over time
- `LINE SPECTRUM` - Shows frequency spectrum using FFT
- `BAR SPECTRUM` - Shows 16 frequency bands with peak indicators
- `CUBE` - 3D wireframe cube that rotates and bounces with audio
- `STEREO LINE SPECTRUM` - Horizontal frequency spectrum with true stereo processing
- `STEREO BAR SPECTRUM` - Horizontal 8-band equalizer with true stereo processing
- `STARFIELD` - Hyperspace journey with moving stars
- `SKYLINE` - City skyline with buildings responding to audio
- `TUNNEL` - Animated concentric rings moving toward viewer
- `PULSE GRID` - Mirrored frequency grid with pulsing cells
- `MIDI PIANO ROLL` - Shows real-time piano roll of incoming MIDI notes

## Display Conditions

To enable the visualizer display, you must first enable the VU meter:

1. Turn :key[AffectEntire] on
2. Select the `LEVEL/PAN` mod button
3. Press the `LEVEL/PAN` mod button again to toggle the VU Meter on
   - The `LEVEL/PAN` mod button will blink when the VU meter is active

The visualizer only appears when all of the following conditions are met:

- **Community Setting**: Visualizer must be set to something other than Off.
- **VU Meter**: The VU meter must be enabled as described above
- **AffectEntire**: The :key[AffectEntire] button must remain enabled
- **LEVEL/PAN Mod Button**: The `LEVEL/PAN` mod button must remain selected

The visualizer will automatically appear in the OLED display area when these conditions are satisfied, replacing the standard VU meter display. The VU meter will stop displaying (and therefore the visualizer will be hidden) if you switch mod button selections, turn :key[AffectEntire] off, select a clip, or exit Song/Arranger views.

Alternatively, you can use the independent visualizer toggle to display the visualizer without needing to enable the VU meter. Press :key[Shift] + `LEVEL/PAN` mod button to toggle the visualizer on or off independently. This allows you to view visualizations in situations where the VU meter conditions cannot be met.

## Clip-Specific Visualization

The visualizer displays waveforms for individual instrument clips (Synth, Kit, and Audio clips) alongside the global mix visualization. This allows you to monitor the audio output of specific clips in real-time.

### When Clip Visualization Activates

Clip-specific visualization automatically activates in the following situations:

- **Instrument Clip View**: When viewing a Synth, Kit, or Audio clip
- **Keyboard Screen**: When in keyboard view for a Synth or Kit clip
- **Holding Clips**: When holding a clip pad in Session or Arranger view

### Clip Visualization Features

- **Always Waveform Mode**: Clip visualization always displays in Waveform mode for optimal clip monitoring
- **Program Name Display**: Shows a popup with the instrument/program name when entering clip visualization mode
- **Automatic Context Switching**: Seamlessly switches between global mix and clip-specific visualization based on your current view and actions
- **Audio Source Isolation**: Displays the actual output of the specific clip, including all effects and processing applied to that clip

### Auto-Hide on Silence

Both global and clip-specific visualizers automatically hide after 1 second of audio silence to prevent displaying noise or empty waveforms. This helps maintain a clean interface when audio is not present and prevents visual distractions from noise floor signals.
