The Visualizer feature provides real-time audio visualizations on the OLED display, showing different representations of the audio signal. It was added in <Badge text="c1.4" variant="tip" /> and includes three main visualization modes (Waveform, Line Spectrum, Bar Spectrum) that can be selected as defaults, plus additional special visualizers available via hot keys. The visualizer replaces the VU meter display when active and provides visual feedback for your audio output.

## Enabling the Visualizer

The visualizer must first be enabled in the Community Settings menu:

1. Press the :key[Shift + Select] button to open the Settings menu
2. Navigate to `COMMUNITY FEATURES`
3. Select `VISUALIZER`
The visualizer must first be enabled in the Community Settings menu:
1. Press the :key[Shift + Select] button to open the Settings menu
2. Navigate to `COMMUNITY FEATURES`
3. Select `VISUALIZER`
4. Choose one of the main visualization modes:
   - `OFF` - Visualizer disabled (default)
   - `WAVEFORM` - Shows audio waveform over time
   - `LINE SPECTRUM` - Shows frequency spectrum using FFT
   - `MIDI PIANO ROLL` - Shows real-time piano roll of incoming MIDI notes

Additional special visualizers are available via hot key controls but cannot be selected as the default mode:
- `BAR SPECTRUM` - Shows 16 frequency bands with peak indicators
- `STEREO LINE SPECTRUM` - Horizontal frequency spectrum with true stereo processing
- `STEREO BAR SPECTRUM` - Horizontal 8-band equalizer with true stereo processing
- `CUBE` - 3D wireframe cube that rotates and bounces with audio
- `TUNNEL` - Animated concentric rings moving toward viewer
- `STARFIELD` - Hyperspace journey with moving stars
- `SKYLINE` - City skyline with buildings responding to audio
- `PULSE GRID` - Mirrored frequency grid with pulsing cells

## Display Conditions

To enable the visualizer display, you must first enable the VU meter:

1. Turn :key[AffectEntire] on
2. Select the `LEVEL/PAN` mod button
3. Press the `LEVEL/PAN` mod button again to toggle the VU Meter on
   - The `LEVEL/PAN` mod button will blink when the VU meter is active

The visualizer only appears when all of the following conditions are met:

- **Community Setting**: Visualizer must be set to Waveform, Line Spectrum, Bar Spectrum, Tunnel, Starfield, Skyline, or Pulse Grid (not Off). Special visualizers are only accessible via CV button.
- **VU Meter**: The VU meter must be enabled as described above
- **AffectEntire**: The :key[AffectEntire] button must remain enabled
- **LEVEL/PAN Mod Button**: The `LEVEL/PAN` mod button must remain selected

The visualizer will automatically appear in the OLED display area when these conditions are satisfied, replacing the standard VU meter display. The VU meter will stop displaying (and therefore the visualizer will be hidden) if you switch mod button selections, turn :key[AffectEntire] off, select a clip, or exit Song/Arranger views.

Alternatively, you can use the independent visualizer toggle to display the visualizer without needing to enable the VU meter. Press :key[Shift] + `LEVEL/PAN` mod button to toggle the visualizer on or off independently. This allows you to view visualizations in situations where the VU meter conditions cannot be met.

## Visualization Modes

### Waveform Mode <Badge text="c1.4 Feature" variant="tip" />

Waveform mode displays the audio signal as a continuous waveform over time.

- Shows raw audio signal amplitude from a recent time window

To activate Line Spectrum mode, press the :key[KIT] button while the visualizer is active.

### MIDI Piano Roll Mode <Badge text="c1.4 Feature" variant="tip" />

MIDI Piano Roll mode displays a real-time piano roll visualization of incoming MIDI notes. The visualization shows note on/off events as they happen, creating a dynamic representation of MIDI activity.

- Shows incoming MIDI notes as horizontal bars across the keyboard
- Note velocity is represented by bar brightness/intensity
- Provides real-time feedback for MIDI input and sequencing
- Helps visualize MIDI note patterns and timing
- Useful for monitoring MIDI input from external devices or internal sequencing

To activate MIDI Piano Roll mode, press the :key[MIDI] button while the visualizer is active.

- Includes peak indicators with decay
- Applies temporal smoothing for stability
- Visualizes frequency response and mix balance

To activate Bar Spectrum mode, press the :key[CV] button while the visualizer is active (cycles through special visualizers).

### Stereo Line Spectrum Mode <Badge text="c1.4 Feature" variant="tip" />

Stereo Line Spectrum mode displays frequency analysis in a horizontal mirrored layout with true stereo processing.

- Shows real-time frequency spectrum with horizontal orientation
- Frequency bands from low (bottom) to high (top) along display height
- Processes left and right channels separately
- Uses logarithmic scaling optimized for horizontal display
- Applies temporal smoothing to reduce flicker

To activate Stereo Line Spectrum mode, press the :key[CV] button while the visualizer is active (cycles through special visualizers).

### Stereo Bar Spectrum Mode <Badge text="c1.4 Feature" variant="tip" />

Stereo Bar Spectrum mode displays 8 frequency bands in a horizontal mirrored equalizer layout with true stereo processing.

- Shows 8 bars representing frequency band energy for left and right channels
- Processes stereo audio with separate channel analysis

## Hot Key Controls

When the visualizer is active (displaying on screen), you can switch between modes using the following hot keys:

- :key[SYNTH] - Switch to Waveform mode
- :key[KIT] - Switch to Line Spectrum mode
- :key[MIDI] - Switch to MIDI Piano Roll mode
- :key[CV] - Cycle through special visualizers (Bar Spectrum → Stereo Line Spectrum → Stereo Bar Spectrum → Cube → Skyline → Starfield → Tunnel → Pulse Grid)

These mode changes are temporary for the current session and don't affect your community setting preference.

You can also toggle the visualizer on or off independently using :key[Shift] + `LEVEL/PAN` mod button. This provides a quick way to enable the visualizer without needing to set up the VU meter conditions, and shows popup feedback indicating the current state.

## Tips and Usage

- **Mixing**: The Bar Spectrum mode can help you identify problematic frequency ranges in your mix
- **Sound Design**: The Line Spectrum mode provides insight into the harmonic content of your sounds
- **Troubleshooting**: The Waveform mode can help identify clipping or level issues
- **Quick Mode Switching**: Use the hot keys to quickly compare different visualization perspectives
- **Independent Access**: Use :key[Shift] + `LEVEL/PAN` mod button to quickly toggle the visualizer on or off without setting up VU meter conditions, perfect for quick visual checks during production

The visualizer provides valuable visual feedback for your audio production workflow, making it easier to monitor and understand your sound in real-time.
