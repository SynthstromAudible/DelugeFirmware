Capture recent audio on demand. Never miss a happy accident again.

This feature has been tested on the OLED version of the Deluge.

## Description

The Retrospective Sampler continuously records audio in a rolling buffer. When you hear something you want to keep, long-press **RECORD** to save it instantly to a WAV file.

If you're in a Kit with a drum pad selected, the sample is automatically loaded into that pad and the waveform editor opens so you can trim the start and end points immediately.

### Use Cases

- **Build kits quickly** from incoming samples - connect external gear and capture sounds on the fly
- **Modular tweaking** - dial in a perfect patch, then capture it without stopping your workflow
- **Resample your performance** - capture the master output to save a great take
- **Happy accidents** - never lose an unexpected sound you want to keep

## Settings

Navigate to **Settings > Community Features > Retro Sampler** to configure:

| Setting | Options | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Enable | On / Off | Off | Enable or disable the feature |
| Source | Input / Master | Input | What audio to capture |
| Duration | 5s / 15s / 30s / 60s | 5s | How much audio to keep in the buffer |
| Bit Depth | 16-bit / 24-bit | 16-bit | Audio quality vs memory usage |
| Channels | Mono / Stereo | Mono | Mono saves memory, stereo preserves panning |
| Ext In Monitor | On / Off | Off | Pass external input audio through to outputs (only when Source is Input) |
| Normalize | On / Off | Off | Automatically normalize audio level when saving |

### Memory Usage

The buffer is allocated in external SDRAM when enabled. The default settings (5s mono 16-bit) use only **0.4 MB**:

| Duration | Mono 16-bit | Stereo 16-bit | Mono 24-bit | Stereo 24-bit |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| 5s | **0.4 MB** | 0.9 MB | 0.6 MB | 1.3 MB |
| 15s | 1.3 MB | 2.6 MB | 2.0 MB | 4.0 MB |
| 30s | 2.6 MB | 5.3 MB | 4.0 MB | 7.9 MB |
| 60s | 5.3 MB | 10.6 MB | 7.9 MB | 15.9 MB |

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Enable **Retro Sampler** in Community Features
2. Play, jam, or record - audio is continuously captured
3. When you hear something worth keeping, **long-press RECORD**
4. The sample is saved to `SAMPLES/RETRO/RETRxxxx.WAV`

### Kit Workflow (Recommended)

For the fastest workflow when building kits from external sources:

1. Enable Retro Sampler with **Input** source
2. Connect your external gear (synth, modular, drum machine, etc.)
3. Create or open a Kit
4. Tweak your external source until you hear something you like
5. Long-press **RECORD**
6. A new drum row is created and the sample is loaded into it
7. The view scrolls to show the new drum row
8. The waveform editor opens automatically so you can trim start/end points
9. Press **BACK** to exit the editor and return to the clip view
10. The new drum is selected and ready to audition - repeat to build your kit!

### Source Options

- **Input**: Captures from the audio input - ideal for sampling external gear, modular synths, or microphones
- **Master**: Captures the final mix output - great for resampling your entire performance

### Input Monitoring

When using **Input** as the source, enable **Monitor** to hear the input audio through the Deluge's outputs. This lets you hear what you're capturing in real-time.

When Monitor is enabled:
- Input audio passes through to the main outputs
- Mono input (when Channels is set to Mono) is sent to both left and right outputs
- No need to set up a separate Audio Clip for monitoring

When Monitor is disabled:
- Audio is still captured to the buffer, you just can't hear it through the Deluge
- Useful if you're monitoring through your external source directly

## Tips

- The buffer only records while the feature is enabled - disable it to save memory when not needed
- Start with **5s mono** (the default) - it uses minimal memory and is plenty for capturing drum hits or short phrases
- Increase duration to **30s or 60s** for longer phrases or if you want more buffer time
- Samples are saved with sequential numbering (RETR0001.WAV, RETR0002.WAV, etc.)
- Short samples (<2 seconds) default to ONE-SHOT mode, longer samples default to CUT mode
- When in a Kit, a new drum row is always created - existing drums are never overwritten
- The waveform editor only opens automatically when in a Kit context
- Enable **Normalize** to automatically maximize the audio level when saving (useful for quiet sources)

## File Location

All retrospective samples are saved to: `SAMPLES/RETRO/`

You can browse this folder later to reload samples or manage your captures.
