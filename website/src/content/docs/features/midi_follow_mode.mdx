## Description

Master MIDI follow mode whereby after setting a master MIDI follow channel for Synth/MIDI/CV clips, Kit clips, and for Parameters, all MIDI (notes + cc’s) received will be directed to control the active or selected clip. MIDI follow mode does not control song parameters.

- Note: although there are three MIDI follow channel's (A/B/C), all three channels will control the instrument of the active context. The three follow channel's allows you to learn different devices to MIDI follow, should you require device specific channel settings.

Comes with a MIDI feedback mode to send updated parameter values on the MIDI follow feedback channel for mapped MIDI cc's. Feedback is sent whenever you change context on the deluge and whenever parameter values for the active context are changed.

Comes with an XML file (`SETTINGS/MIDIFollow.XML`) with default CC to Deluge parameter mappings. You can customize this XML file to map CC's differently as required.

**Simple summary:**

- Set your follow and feedback channel(s)
- Set your MIDI Controller(s) to the same channel(s)
- Set a root note for your kits
- Confirm that your controller cc's are mapped to the parameters you want (via `SETTINGS/MIDIFollow.XML`)
- Play and control the deluge instruments and parameters with ease!

**No more re-learning your MIDI controllers every time you start a new song, add new clips or change instrument presets.**

- Note: Your existing MIDI learnings will remain untouched and can be used together with the master MIDI follow mode.

## Usage

### Set Master MIDI Follow Channel(s), Set Kit Root Note, Enable/Disable Pop-ups and Enable/Disable MIDI Feedback

To use MIDI follow mode, you will need to configure the various MIDI Follow Mode settings by entering the settings menu and going to the sub menu for `MIDI > MIDI-Follow`

- In the `MIDI-Follow > Channel` submenu, set the channel between 1 and 16 for Non-MPE or MPE Lower/Upper for MPE. There are three channel's (A/B/C) available to accomodate learning multiple devices / channels to MIDI Follow Mode.
  - You can quickly learn a Channel (and Device) by pressing :key[LEARN] and sending a MIDI CC/Note while in the Channel submenu
  - You can quickly unlearn a Channel by pressing :key[SHIFT] + :key[LEARN] while in the Channel submenu
    - Note: if no Channel has been set, MIDI Follow Mode will be Disabled
- In the `MIDI-Follow > Kit Root Note` submenu, set the root note for kits between 1 and 127 in order to map MIDI Notes received to Kit rows. The root note corresponds to the bottom row in a Kit.
- In the `MIDI-Follow > Display Param` submenu, enable or disable param pop-ups
- In the `MIDI-Follow > Feedback > Channel` submenu, Enable or Disable MIDI follow feedback by setting a MIDI Follow Feedback Channel.
  - You can choose MIDI Follow Channel A/B/C or NONE. Thus, when you update MIDI Follow Channel A/B/C it will automatically update the channel used for MIDI Feedback.
    - Note: if no Channel has been set, MIDI Feedback will be Disabled
- In the `MIDI-Follow > Feedback > Automation Feedback` submenu, Enable or Disable MIDI follow feedback for automated parameters and set the rate at which feedback for automated parameters is sent
  - With Automation Feedback enabled, the Deluge will also send feedback while you are holding a note (e.g. step editing automation). This will override the sending of automation feedback until you release the note.
- In the `MIDI-Follow > Feedback > Filter Responses` submenu, Enable or Disable filtering of responses received within 1 second of sending a MIDI feedback value update.

### **Input Device Differentiation**

If you wish to use Input Device Differentiation with MIDI Follow Mode, you will need to enable Input Differentiation and learn your device to the required MIDI Follow Channel(s).

To enable Input Differentiation, go to `SETTINGS > MIDI > Differentiate Inputs (DIFF)`

To learn the device, you need to enter the MIDI Follow Channel submenu, hold :key[LEARN] and then send a MIDI Note or CC.

For example, if you enter the channel submenu (e.g. `MIDI-Follow > Channel > Channel A` or `MIDI-Follow > Channel > Channel B`) and then `press and and hold the Learn button` and then send a Note to the deluge, the Deluge will update the the Synth channel to match the device and, if you are using an OLED Deluge, it will display the Device that has been learned on the screen.

### **Learning a Channel / Root Note**

As explained above, in the MIDI-Follow Channel submenu's you can hold learn to learn a device for input differentiation. You can also use this same functionality with input differentiation off to quickly update the MIDI-Follow channel's to match the channel used by your device. Simply hold Learn and send a Note or CC for any of the channels.

You can also use this method for updating the Kit Root Note. In the Kit Root Note menu, hold :key[LEARN] and send a MIDI note from your device to update the Kit Root Note.

### **Unlearning a Channel and Device**

You can unlearn a channel and device by pressing :key[SHIFT] + :key[LEARN] while in the channel submenu's.

If you unlearn all MIDI Follow channels, MIDI Follow Mode will be disabled (including MIDI Feedback).
If set the MIDI Feedback channel to NONE, MIDI Feedback will be disabled.

You can also unlearn a channel using the :key[TURN SELECT] by scrolling between MPE Upper Zone and Channel 1.

### **Notes**

Notes and note associated performance data received (e.g. CC1, MPE CC74) on the master MIDI channel will play the instrument in the active clip (e.g. a synth, MIDI clip, cv clip, or all kit rows).

- Note 1: You can play a synth, kit, MIDI or cv clip without entering the clip from arranger or song view. Simply press and hold the clip :key[PAD] in arranger or song view to preview the clip (as you would to change the parameters of that clip with the gold encoders) and then send notes from your MIDI controller.

- Note 2: For Kit's, the bottom Kit row is mapped by default to the root note C1 (note # 36). All kit rows above are mapped to note's incrementally (e.g. 36, 37, 38, etc.). This kit root note # is configurable (from 0 to 127) through the Kit Root Note submenu.

- Note 3: MIDI Follow mode will always send notes to the active clip. This means that if you leave or unselect a clip, you can still send notes to that clip because in the Deluge, that clip is still recognized as the last active clip.

### **CC's**

CC's received on the master MIDI channel that have been mapped to a parameter will change the value of that parameter in the active context (e.g. audio clip or instrument clip).

The parameters are controlled only in the current context.

- So if you enter a specific synth clip, it will only control that synths filter. If you are in a kit clip it will either control the entire kit or a specific row in that clip (depending on whether you have :key[AffectEntire] enabled or not)
- If you are in song view or arranger view and holding down a clip (selecting it), it will only control the parameters for that selected clip.
- If you are in song view and haven't selected a clip, it will control the parameters of the active instrument of the last clip selected.
- In other words it checks what context you’re in and controls the parameters of that context.

#### Default MIDI CC Mappings

A default set of MIDI CC # to Deluge Parameter mappings has been created for MIDI Follow Mode. When you launch the Deluge after installing the firmware with MIDI Follow Mode, an XML file will be created in the `SETTINGS` folder in the root of the SD card titled `MIDIFollow.XML`

The default mappings have taken into account standard MIDI CC to parameter mappings and usages. It has also taken into account reserving of MIDI CC's for future Deluge functionality / feature implementations.

The default MIDI CC to parameter mappings, as mapped the to the parameter shortcuts on the Deluge grid are as follows:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0a82d14-99db-4c02-b618-7906238ec2c8)

Additionally, there are other parameters not in the grid that are mapped to MIDI CC's, which are the following:

- Compressor Threshold: CC 27
- Stutter Rate: CC 20
- New arpeggiator parameters:
  - Rhythm: CC 42
  - Sequence Length: CC 43
  - Chord Polyphony: CC 44
  - Ratchet Amount: CC 45
  - Note Probability: CC 46
  - Bass Probability: CC 47
  - Swap Probability: CC 112
  - Glide Probability: CC 113
  - Chord Probability: CC 48
  - Ratchet Probability: CC 49
  - Spread Octave: CC 39
  - Spread Gate: CC 40

> - See Appendix A for detailed listing and description of default CC # to Parameter mappings.

Here are the MIDI CC #'s that have been reserved for other purposes:

#### Adjust MIDI CC Mappings

MIDI CC mappings for MIDI Follow Mode are saved to the `SETTINGS` folder in the root of your SD card in an XML file called `MIDIFollow.XML`

Within `MIDIFollow.XML`, all Parameters that can mapped to a MIDI CC are listed. The MIDI CC value is enclosed between a Parameter XML tag - e.g. `<lpfFrequency>74</lpfFrequency>` indicates that MIDI CC 74 is mapped to the LPF Frequency parameter. Conversely when a value of 255 is entered (e.g. `<hpfFrequency>255</hpfFrequency>`) it indicates that no MIDI CC value has been mapped to that parameter.

![image](https://github.com/SynthstromAudible/DelugeFirmware/assets/138174805/1ae66f8b-1627-4e2f-a05d-fd7a8c73b62f)
You can manually edit the `MIDIFollow.XML` to enter your MIDI CC mappings to each Parameter.

The defaults from `MIDIFollow.XML` are loaded automatically when you start the Deluge so you can begin controlling the deluge with your MIDI controller right away.

Note: A parameter can only be mapped to one MIDI CC, and viceversa.

#### Display Parameter Names and Values on Screen

> Note: MIDI pop-up's can be disabled in the MIDI Follow Display Param submenu.

For mapped MIDI CC's, a pop up is shown on the display whenever MIDI CC's are received to indicate the name of the parameter that is being controlled by that MIDI CC and the current value being set for that parameter.

::screen[H4sIAAAAAAAACs1S2w3EIAxzIBX3V0ZghI6QUToKIzBiRmCDe4TCld9TVZ0/rMhO7J8AfwFNd0On/qdxbVxK2Y3j4bb5rGuMUW2/dlcyqukJm2TZAMjIz5IqsL8TdGqc+wMzM0KbT25XyPGx43lxCzwz++8VBVPcuKCRQESB8DFpauxYH3dj/fVVrsULM66bqAADAAA=]{alt="MIDI Follow Mode Pop-up"}

Note: if the MIDI CC being received is for a Parameter that cannot be controlled in the current context (e.g. trying to control Attack while in a Kit with :key[AffectEntire] enabled), the pop-up message will say "Can't Control: Parameter Name".

## Re-cap of functionality

1. Added new MIDI submenu for MIDI-Follow where you can:

- Set up to three MIDI Follow Channels and Devices
- Set the MIDI Follow Root Note for Kits
- Enable or Disable MIDI Follow Param Pop-up's
- Enable or Disable MIDI Follow Feedback by setting/unsetting the MIDI Follow Feedback Channel
- Enable or Disable MIDI Follow Feedback for Automated Parameters and set the MIDI Feedback Update Rate
- Enable or Disable MIDI Follow Feedback Filtering of MIDI CC responses received within 1 second of sending feedback

2. When MIDI Follow Mode is enabled, a MIDI Follow Channel has been set, and you have mapped your MIDI CC's, your external controller's Notes and MIDI CC's will be automatically directed to control the Notes of the Active Instrument (e.g. Synth, Kit, MIDI, CV) and Parameters of the Active Instrument or Selected Clip.
3. By default, the root note for kit's is C1 for the bottom kit row but this can be configured in the MIDI Follow menu.
4. Pop-up's are shown on the display for mapped MIDI CC's to show the name of the parameter being controlled and value being set for the parameter. This can be disabled in the menu.
5. MIDI feedback is sent for mapped CC's when the active context changes, change presets, or you change the value of a mapped parameter on the deluge (e.g. using mod encoders or select encoder if you're int he menu). MIDI feedback can be disabled in the menu by setting the MIDI feedback channel to NONE.
6. MIDI feedback for automated parameters can also be sent and can be enabled or disabled in the MIDI feedback sub menu. When enabled, you choose between 3 speeds at which to send feedback for automated parameters: Low (500 ms), Medium (150 ms), High (40 ms). Sending automated parameter feedback can be taxing on the deluge MIDI output system, so depending on the amount of automation you do, you may want to adjust the speed (e.g. slow it down) to not affect the performance of the Deluge.
7. MIDI feedback can cause an undesirable result with certain applications when the application responds back to the Deluge after the Deluge has sent it an updated value (Loopy Pro and Drambo on iPad are known to do this). This can cause lag in the deluge and potential feedback loops. To handle this, a toggable filter was added which ignores messages received for the same ccNumber within 1 second of sending a MIDI feedback update. If the application receiving the MIDI feedback update does not send responses back to the Deluge, then this setting should be set to Disabled in the MIDI Feedback Filter Responses sub menu.
   - Note: To control the deluge with midi follow while receiving midi automation feedback, MIDI Feedback Filter Responses needs to be disabled. If your device requires filter responses to be enabled to avoid a feedback loop, you cannot use that same device to control the deluge while automation feedback is being received - you will only be able to display the automation on your device.

## Troubleshooting

### When using MIDI Follow, you experience MIDI stutter (lag)

If you experience MIDI stutter / lag while using MIDI follow mode, you may need to adjust your MIDI Feedback settings.

Things you can try:

1. Disable MIDI Feedback altogether by setting the MIDI Feedback Channel to NONE in the following sub-menu: `MIDI > MIDI-FOLLOW > FEEDBACK > CHANNEL`

2. Disable MIDI Automation Feedback. Set the following menu to Disabled: `MIDI > MIDI-FOLLOW > FEEDBACK > AUTOMATION FEEDBACK`

3. Slow down MIDI Automation Feedback. Choose a slower Automation Feedback speed (e.g. Low vs High) in the following menu: `MIDI > MIDI-FOLLOW > FEEDBACK > AUTOMATION FEEDBACK`

### When using MIDI Follow, you are unable to record Automation

If you notice that the Deluge's parameter values don't respond to your MIDI controller while trying to record automation when Deluge playback is running, this may be because the Deluge is sending Automation Feedback to your controller and also filtering out (ignoring) the responses received.

To control the Deluge with MIDI Follow with a controller while also receiving Automation Feedback from the Deluge, Filter Responses needs to be disabled in this menu: `MIDI > MIDI-FOLLOW > FEEDBACK > FILTER RESPONSES`

If your device requires Filter Responses to be enabled to avoid a MIDI Feedback loop (see below), you cannot use that same device to control the Deluge while Automation Feedback is being received. Your device will only be able to display the Automation Feedback.

### When using MIDI Follow, you experience a MIDI Feedback loop

If you notice that your MIDI controller's values get stuck while sending MIDI CC's to the Deluge or the Deluge's parameter values get stuck while receiving MIDI CC's from your controller, it is possible that you got stuck in a MIDI feedback loop. This is known to happen with Drambo app for example as this application always respond to the Deluge's MIDI feedback.

In this case, you will need to ensure that MIDI Feedback Filter Responses is set to Enabled in the following menu: `MIDI > MIDI-FOLLOW > FEEDBACK > FILTER RESPONSES`
