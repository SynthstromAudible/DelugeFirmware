This page provides an overview of the Deluge File Browser system which allows you to browse the actual folder structure of the SD card for loading and saving files.

Depending on the type of file you are loading / saving, the file browser will open a specific folder on the SD card.

| Type of file           | SD card folder opened   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Song                   | SONG                    |
| Synth preset           | SYNTHS                  |
| Kit preset             | KITS                    |
| MIDI preset            | MIDI                    |
| MIDI device definition | MIDI_DEVICES/DEFINITION |
| Audio file             | SAMPLES                 |

The file browser can be quickly exited without needing to press back multiple times by instead pressing one of the mute pads.
