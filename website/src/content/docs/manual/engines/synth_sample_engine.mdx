This page provides an overview Deluge Synth Engine.

Sounds on the Deluge may be based on synthesis, samples, or a combination of the two. Basic waveforms can be used, without the need for any pre-recorded wave data. Or, samples can be used and manipulated in much the same way that basic waveforms can.

Placeholder: Break-down and explain the components of the synthesis / sample engine.

- Synth modes (subtractive vs ring mod)
- Types of oscillators
- Creation of voices which trigger oscillator to generate sound
- Envelopes which dictate how long a voice continues to be active
- FM Modulators
- Modulation of synth engine parameters
- Etc
- The signal path
