The Deluge has a number of user interfaces which have been designed to allow the user to interact with the Deluge's various functionality.

What UI you can open / switch to depends on the UI context that a user is currently interacting with. For example, Audio Clip Menu can only be opened when you have are in Audio Clip View.

These user interfaces include:
