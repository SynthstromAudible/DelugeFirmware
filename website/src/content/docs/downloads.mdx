We aim to maintain compatibility, prevent data loss and provide a stable experience but accidents can happen so <strong style={{ color: "#ef494d" }}>please backup your SD card before switching to community firmware to prevent losing data</strong>. You can always go back to the [official firmware](https://synthstrom.com/product/deluge/#downloads) but be aware that songs created with community firmware **can not be loaded by the official firmware**.

## Development (Nightly) Firmware aka 1.3

The current nightly build is available below. The nightly firmware captures the current state of development every day and might be broken but needs to be tested to find out.

Be aware that in addition to new features there are large internal changes - we believe these will make the deluge more efficient and stable in the long term, but there may be short term issues with perceived performance due to interactions between sub systems.
