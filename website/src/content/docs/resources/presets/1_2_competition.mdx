## Presets

We’ve compiled, bug-fixed, tweaked and levelled the entire pack. When you download (instructions below) you’ll get access to…

- 27 Basses

- 7 Leads

We were blown away by the quality of inspiring sounds you shared.

The Deluge is a unique device with a unique community standing behind it. We wanted the patch competition to embody some of that; creativity, expertise, and most of all… fun with a community of like-minded individuals.

A huge thank you goes out to everyone who entered the competition. We also want to thank everyone (and there were a lot of you) who shared ideas, helped manage the process, problem-solved, submitted, voted, and even coded to make this happen.

So - from the bottom of our hearts, thank you everyone. We couldn’t have done it without all of you. :rainbow_heart:
