# Proposed Code Guidelines

## Naming Conventions
### Menu Items
- Menu item strings for oled should be descriptive. *F.e.: `delay divs on golden knobs` as opposed to `alternative golden knob delay params`*
- As much as possible, menu item strings for oled should fit on the display without scrolling to keep the menu scrolling experience as fluent as possible. *F.e.: `stutter quantize` versus `stutter rate quantize`. The same information is conveyed while avoiding a scrolling menu string.*
