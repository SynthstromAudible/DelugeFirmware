            Synthstrom Audible <a target="_blank" href="https://synthstrom.com/open">released the source code</a> of the
            Deluge firmware and started a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SynthstromAudible/DelugeFirmware">Github community project</a> inviting
            everyone to participate in improving and extending the Deluge user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            We aim to maintain compatibility, prevent data loss and provide a stable experience but accidents can happen so <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ef494d;">please backup your SD card before switching to community firmware to prevent losing data</span>.
            You can always go back to the <a target="_blank" href="https://synthstrom.com/product/deluge/#downloads">official firmware</a> but be aware that songs created with community firmware <span style="font-weight: bold;">can not be loaded by the official firmware</span>. 
        </p>

        <h1>Latest Stable Release - 1.1.0 (Beethoven)</h1>
        <p>
            Released June 30th, 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
            This release has even more new features and bugfixes over the 1.0 community release, and should be backwards compatible.
            Please report any bugs <a href="https://github.com/SynthstromAudible/DelugeFirmware/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.yml">on github</a>, as you find them.

        <h1>Development firmware</h1>
        <p>
            The current nightly build is available below. The nightly firmware captures the current state of development every day and might be broken but needs to be tested to find out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Be aware that in addition to new features there are large internal changes - we believe these will make the deluge more efficient and stable in the long term, 
            but there may be short term issues with perceived performance due to interactions between sub systems. 
        </p>
