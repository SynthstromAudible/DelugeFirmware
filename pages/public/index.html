            Synthstrom Audible <a target="_blank" href="https://synthstrom.com/open">released the source code</a> of the
            Deluge firmware and started a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SynthstromAudible/DelugeFirmware">Github community project</a> inviting
            everyone to participate in improving and extending the Deluge user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            We aim to maintain compatibility, prevent data loss and provide a stable experience but accidents can happen so <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ef494d;">please backup your SD card before switching to community firmware to prevent losing data</span>.
            You can always go back to the <a target="_blank" href="https://synthstrom.com/product/deluge/#downloads">official firmware</a> but be aware that songs created with community firmware <span style="font-weight: bold;">can not be loaded by the official firmware</span>. 
        </p>
       
        
        <h1>Release 1.0.1 (Amadeus)</h1>
        <p>
            After months of hard work we are very proud to present you the first release of the community firmware project! 
            We put a lot of effort into making it fast, stable and packed with cool new features for everyone to enjoy.
            It would mean a lot to us if you could report any problems you might have on GitHub or Discord linked below so we can further improve.
            Update JAN 7, 2024 - c1.0.1 released, find the changelog at the end of the release notes.

        <h1>Development firmware</h1>
        <p>
            Following are current nightly and other pre-release firmware builds along with their feature descriptions. 
            The nightly firmware captures the current state of development every day and might be broken but needs to be tested to find out.
            Beta and release candidate firmware will mature into a stable release and receive updates to improve stability without adding new features until it is finished.
        </p>
