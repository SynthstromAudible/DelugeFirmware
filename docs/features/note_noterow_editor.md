## Enhance Note Probability, Iteration and Fill

Enhanced existing note probability, iteration and fill function functionality by enabling you to use each type independently. This means that you can now apply probability to iteration and fill and you can also apply iteration to fill.

Holding a note / note row and turning the select encoder now only changes probability.

To edit note / note row iteration and fill settings you need to access the new note and note row editor menu's.

## Note Editor Menu

### Enter Note Editor Menu

Hold a note and press the select encoder to enter the note editor menu. 

The note you were holding will be the note selected when you enter the note editor.

### Selecting a Note

While in the note editor menu, the selected note will blink. You can select other notes by pressing the notes on the grid.

While in the note editor you can also vertical scroll or horizontal scroll / zoom to select other notes. 

You can select other note's by:
- pressing the notes on the grid
- vertical or horizontal scroll / zoom to select other notes

Note: if you scroll, the note you previously selected will get de-selected. If you were in a note parameter menu, it will kick you back out to the main note editor menu. If you then try to enter one of those note parameter menu's, it will tell you to select a note first.

### Note Actions

While in the note editing menu with a note selected, you are able to perform other functions as if you were holding that note, including:

- pressing and turning the vertical encoder to edit note repeats
