## Enhance Note Probability, Iteration and Fill

Enhanced existing note probability, iteration and fill function functionality by enabling you to use each type independently. This means that you can now apply probability to iteration and fill and you can also apply iteration to fill.

To edit probability, hold a note / audition pad and turn the select encoder to the left to display current probability value / set new probability value.

To edit iterance, hold a note / audition pad and turn the select encoder to the right to display current iterance value / set new iterance value.

To edit fill, you need to access the new note and note row editor menu's.

## Note Editor Menu

### Enter Note Editor Menu

Hold a note and press the select encoder to enter the note editor menu. 

The note you were holding will be the note selected when you enter the note editor. If playback is off, you will hear what that note sounds like.

### Selecting a Note

While in the note editor menu, the selected note will blink. 

You can select another note by pressing the note on the grid. 

You can vertical scroll, horizontal scroll, and zoom in / out to find a note you want to edit.

Note: if you scroll, the note you previously selected will get de-selected. If you were in a note parameter menu, it will kick you back out to the main note editor menu. If you then try to enter one of those note parameter menu's, it will tell you to select a note first.

### Note Actions

While in the note editing menu with a note selected, you are able to perform other functions as if you were holding that note, including:

- pressing and turning the vertical encoder to edit note repeats
- editing parameters using the gold knob to enter parameter automation

### Exit Note Editor Menu

You can exit the menu by pressing BACK to back out or you can press the greyed out Mute / Audition pads in the Sidebar

## Note Row Editor Menu

### Enter Note Row Editor Menu

Hold a note row audition pad and press the select encoder to enter the note row editor menu. 

The note row you were holding will be the note row selected when you enter the note row editor.

While in the Note Row Editor Menu, the audition pads will not sound. They will function as if you are holding Shift to select rows silently.

### Selecting A Note Row

While in the note row editor menu, the selected note row audition pad will blink. 

You can select other note row's by:
- pressing the note row audition pad
- vertical scrolling with the vertical encoder

### Note Row Actions

While in the note row editing menu with a note row selected, you are able to perform other functions as if you were holding that note row's audition pad, including:

- pressing and turning the vertical encoder to enter euclidean notes
- pressing and turning the horizontal encoder to rotate the note row

By physically holding an audition pad you can:

- edit a note row's length by turning the horizontal encoder
- zoom in / out by pressing and turning the horizontal encoder

### Editing Notes

While holding shift or sticky shift, you can:
- add / remove notes on the grid
- press and hold one or more notes to edit the same parameter selected for the row but for only for the notes you selected
- with a note selected you can edit its velocity by turning the horizontal encoder <>
- with a note selected you can nudge it by pressing and turning the horizontal encoder <>
- with a note selected you can edit its repeats by pressing and turning the vertical encoder

### Exit Note Row Editor Menu

You can exit the menu by pressing BACK to back out or you can press the greyed out Main Grid Pads

Note: if you have shift enabled, pressing Main Grid Pads will not exit the menu as it allows you to edit notes on the grid, you need to turn shift off first.
