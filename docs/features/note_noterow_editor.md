## Enhance Note Probability, Iteration and Fill

Enhanced existing note probability, iteration and fill function functionality by enabling you to use each type independently. This means that you can now apply probability to iteration and fill and you can also apply iteration to fill.

Holding a note / note row and turning the select encoder now only changes probability.

To edit note / note row iteration and fill settings you need to access the new note and note row editor menu's.

## Note Editor Menu

Hold a note and press the select encoder to enter the note editor menu. While in the note editor menu, the selected note will blink. You can select other notes by pressing the notes on the grid.

While in the note editing menu with a note selected, you are able to perform other functions as if you were holding that note, including:

- pressing and turning the vertical encoder to edit note repeats
- editing parameters using the gold knob to enter parameter automation

While in the note editor you can also vertical scroll or horizontal scroll / zoom to select other notes. 
- Note: if you scroll, the note you previously selected will get de-selected. If you were in a note parameter menu, it will kick you back out to the main note editor menu. If you then try to enter one of those note parameter menu's, it will tell you to select a note first.

### Exit Note Editor Menu

You can exit the menu by pressing BACK to back out or you can press the greyed out Mute / Audition pads in the Sidebar

## Note Row Editor Menu

Hold a note row audition pad and press the select encoder to enter the note row editor menu. While in the note row editor menu, the select note row audition pad will blink. You can select other note row's by pressing the note row audition pad.

While in the note row editing menu with a note row selected, you are able to perform other functions as if you were holding that note row's audition pad, including:

- pressing and turning the vertical encoder to enter euclidean notes
- pressing and turning the horizontal encoder to rotate the note row

While in the note row editor you can also vertical scroll to select other note rows. 

### Exit Note Row Menu

You can exit the menu by pressing BACK to back out or you can press the greyed out Main Grid Pads
