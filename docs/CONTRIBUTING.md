# How to contribute to DelugeFirmware

Above all, thank you for your interest in both the Synthstrom Deluge and being a contributor!

Please see also, the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) document.

## Bug reports

Even if you are not a software developer you can contribute immensely by informing us about bugs and other problems you
notice during usage or testing of the firmwares created from this repository and related projects:

* Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/SynthstromAudible/DelugeFirmware/issues) highlighting as much *relevant*
  context about the bug as possible.
* Quality of information (rather than quantity, necessarily) is key!
  See [How to Report Bugs Effectively](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html) by Simon Tatham for more
  on this topic.
* Do let us know whether the bug was found on an OLED or 7seg Deluge as this may be important as well as the source and
  version of firmware (branch/etc.).
* Where the bug exists in build scripts, editors, or other development, building, and debugging processes, please
  provide excerpts of the relevant logs if you suspect they might be helpful.
* Bugs in related projects should be submitted to the appropriate issue tracker:
    * DelugeProbe: [litui/delugeprobe](https://github.com/litui/delugeprobe).
    * DBT-Toolchain: [litui/dbt-toolchain](https://github.com/litui/dbt-toolchain).

## Ideas, feature requests, suggestions and discussions

Please use the [Discussions](https://github.com/SynthstromAudible/DelugeFirmware/discussions) feature in our repository
which allows both creating discussion, ideas, polls and more as well as voting on existing topics.

* Please search first if there is already a (
  draft) [Pull request](https://github.com/SynthstromAudible/DelugeFirmware/pulls) or existing Discussion item related
  to your idea and start your discussion from there if possible.
* Reading, voting and commenting on discussion items and Pull requests will help a lot to improve the direction of the
  project.
* Please use the repository [issue](https://github.com/SynthstromAudible/DelugeFirmware/issues) tracker for problem
  reporting.
* For further inspiration and discussion there is also
  the [Deluge Suggestions area](https://forums.synthstrom.com/categories/deluge-suggestions)
  and [Open Source area](https://forums.synthstrom.com/categories/open-source-) on
  the [Synthstrom Forum](https://forums.synthstrom.com).
* For more in-depth technical discussion you are welcome to join the #dev-chat channel in
  the [Deluge User Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gWaJEh6pPP).

## Code review and testing

Pull requests that are no longer marked as Draft and are open for merging should be ready to test and any help is
appreciated.

* This includes both building and testing the firmware as well as reading and reviewing the source code.
* Please use the review and discussion functionality provided within GitHub.
* Code reviews are intended to increase quality and should not go into nitpicking, please remember
  the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* Final decisions about merging of Pull requests is up to the code owners, see below and in [Governance](GOVERNANCE.md).
