# Deluge Community Firmware Code of Conduct

The [Synthstrom Audible Forum Rules & Guidelines](https://synthstrom.com/synthstrom-audible-forum-rules-guidelines/) document was used as a starting point for this Code of Conduct.

Unless otherwise stated, this Code of Conduct applies to all areas of the Synthstrom Github as well as discussions about contributions in the Synthstrom Audible Forum, Discord, email, contributor forks, and other related venues.

## Guidelines

1. **Treat other members with the respect they deserve.** This should go without saying, but treat others like you would like to be treated.
2. **Insulting and flaming or personal attacks against contributors or staff will be not tolerated**
3. **Please be considerate in language you use with other contributors and in discussion of contributions, don’t be petty or infantile.** Be generous in interpretation of others' intentions.
4. **No doxxing or malicious activity.** This includes any and all illegal activity and intention to do harm to others and/or their systems, property, or reputations.
5. **No inappropriate material** in comments, discussions, or submissions.  If you would not feel comfortable viewing it at work, or in front of children or parents, don’t post it.
6. **No discrimination on the basis of sex, gender, race, sexuality, class, age, ability, or any other way we identify ourselves.**  This ties into rule 1. but is listed as its own rule in order to make it explicit that participation in the Deluge Firmware open source project should be a safe place for everyone, regardless of how you identify yourself, to come together over a common interest.

Where forums and discussion areas (eg: Discord) have their own terms, codes of conduct, and guidelines for behaviour and submissions, it's expected that these be similarly upheld as part of your participation in this project.

## Enforcement

One violation of the above guidelines will result in a warning, a second violation will result in a 24 hour ban and a third violation, a full ban (potentially across all of the Synthstrom Audible forum, the Synthstrom Audible Discord, and the Synthstrom Firmware GitHub Project).

Please play it cool.

**Some extreme violations may result in an immediate ban.**
