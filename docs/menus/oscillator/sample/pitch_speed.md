Controls linking of the pitch and speed of samples.

When set to <string-for name="STRING_FOR_LINKED">LINKED</string-for>, the time stretcher is not used and sample length
will very with pitch. <string-for name="STRING_FOR_INDEPENDENT">INDEPENDENT</string-for> has the opposite behavior,
decoupling playback speed from pitch.
