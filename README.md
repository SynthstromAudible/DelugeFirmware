# Deluge Community Firmware

## Dear Deluge owners
If you want to start using the community firmware please visit https://synthstromaudible.github.io/DelugeFirmware/ for all relevant details.

## About
The [Deluge](https://synthstrom.com/product/deluge/) from [Synthstrom Audible](https://synthstrom.com/) is a portable sequencer, synthesizer and sampler. Synthstrom Audible decided to [open source](https://synthstrom.com/open/) the firmware application that runs on the Deluge to allow the community to customize and extend the capabilities of the device. 

The hardware is built around a Renesas RZ/A1L processor with an Arm® Cortex®-A9 core running at 400MHz and 3MB of on-chip SRAM. Connected to that is a 64MB SDRAM chip, a PIC for button handling and either a 7-Segment array or an OLED screen. The application is written in C and C++ and some occasional assembly in bare metal style without an operating system.
