          =====================================================

          Experimental firmware fork with additional sound design features.
          Based on Deluge Community Firmware 1.3.

          See the update guide for detailed instructions on how to install this
          firmware. If you have never updated your Deluge before, please make
          extra sure to read this, as you might want to update your bootloader
          first to not risk rendering your Deluge inoperable!

          https://github.com/SynthstromAudible/DelugeFirmware/wiki/Update-guide

          Also, make a backup copy of your SD card before proceeding, just for
          additional safety.

          If you have done firmware updates on your Deluge before, but need a
          quick refresher on how to do it:

            * Copy the .bin file to the top level of your SD card.
            * Make sure that you have removed any other/leftover .bin files from
              there, otherwise the Deluge cannot know which one to use.
            * Turn your Deluge off.
            * Insert the SD card.
            * Hold SHIFT on the Deluge and power it back on. You can let go of
              the shift key once the update has begun.
