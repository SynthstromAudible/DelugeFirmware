          =====================================================

          See the update guide for detailed instructions on how to install this
          firmware. If you have never updated your Deluge before, please make
          extra sure to read this, as you might want to update your bootloader
          first to not risk rendering your Deluge inoperable!

          https://github.com/SynthstromAudible/DelugeFirmware/wiki/Update-guide

          Also, make a backup copy of your SD card before proceeding, just for
          additional safety.

          More information is also available on the project's website:
          https://synthstromaudible.github.io/DelugeFirmware/

          If you have done firmware updates on your Deluge before, but need a
          quick refresher on how to do it: Copy the .bin file to the top level
          of your SD card. Turn your Deluge off, insert the SD card, hold Shift
          on the Deluge and power it back on.
