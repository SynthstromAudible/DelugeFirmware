 * Kits are made up of multiple Drums. Even when they are not drum sounds, the class is called Drum, for better or worse.
 * In most instructional material for users, Synthstrom has referred to them often as
 * “items within kits”, or sometimes “rows” or “sounds” where applicable.
 *
 * Types of Drum are MIDIDrum, GateDrum, and SoundDrum (most often a sample).
