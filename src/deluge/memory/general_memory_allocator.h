/*
 * ======================= MEMORY ALLOCATION ========================
 *
 * The Deluge codebase uses a custom memory allocation system, largely necessitated by the fact that
 * the Deluge’s CPU has 3MB ram, plus the Deluge has an external 64MB SDRAM IC, and both of these
 * need to have dynamic memory allocation as part of the same system.
 *
 * The internal RAM on the CPU is a bit faster, so is allocated first when available.
 * But huge blocks of data like cached Clusters of audio data from the SD card are always
 * placed on the external RAM IC because they would overwhelm the internal RAM too quickly,
 * preventing potentially thousands of small objects which need to be accessed all the time
 * from being placed in that fast internal RAM.
 *
 * Various objects or pieces of data remain loaded (cached) in RAM even when they are no longer necessarily needed.
 * The main example of this is audio data in Clusters, discussed above. The base class for all such
 * objects is Stealable, and as the name suggests, their memory may usually be “stolen” when needed.
 *
 * Most Stealables store a “numReasonsToBeLoaded”, which counts how many “things” are requiring
 * that object to be retained in RAM. E.g. a Cluster of audio data would have a “reason” to
 * remain loaded in RAM if it is currently being played back. If that numReasons goes down to 0,
 * then that Stealable object is usually free to have its memory stolen.
 *
 * Stealables which in fact are eligible to be stolen at a given moment are stored in a queue which
 * prioritises stealing of the audio data which is less likely to be needed, e.g. if it belongs to a
 * Song that’s no longer loaded. But, to avoid overcomplication, this queue is not adhered to in the
 * case where a neighbouring region of memory is chosen for allocation (or itself being stolen) when
 * the allocation requires that the object in question have its memory stolen too in order to make
 * up a large enough allocation.
