/**
 *  Interface for filters in the sound engine
 * This is a CRTP base class for all filters used in the sound engine. To implement a new filter,
 * Add an entry for the filter in deluge::dsp::filter::FilterMode
 * Create a subclass of Filter, using itself as the template parameter (the CRTP). Then implement the following methods:
 * a. setConfig. This is run when the filter is reconfigured, and should be used to convert the user-level parameters
 * (frequency, resonance) to internal parameters b. doFilter runs the filter on a series of samples, densely packed c.
 * doFilterStereo runs the filter on stereo samples packed in the LRLRLR... format. d. reset resets any internal state
 * of the filter to avoid clicks when processing a new voice Then add a menu entry for the filter, and add item to
 * string conversion in ModControllableAudio::switchLPFMode Filters are extremely sensitive to performance, as they're
 * run per channel, per voice. One additional multiply instruction can have a noticeable impact on maximum voice count,
 * so care should be taken to ensure any filter is as performant as possible.
