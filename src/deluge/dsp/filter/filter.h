/// @brief Interface for filters in the sound engine
///This is a CRTP base class for all filters used in the sound engine. To implement a new filter,
///Add an entry for the filter in deluge::dsp::filter::LPFMode
///Create a subclass of Filter, using itself as the template parameter (the CRTP). Then implement the following methods:
///	a. setConfig. This is run when the filter is reconfigured, and should be used to convert the user-level parameters (frequency, resonance) to internal parameters
///	b. doFilter runs the filter on a series of samples, densely packed
/// c. doFilterStereo runs the filter on stereo samples packed in the LRLRLR... format.
/// d. reset resets any internal state of the filter to avoid clicks when processing a new voice
///Add a menu entry for the filter.
///Filters are extremely sensitive to performance, as they're run per channel, per voice. One additional multiply instruction can have a noticeable impact on maximum voice count, so care should be taken to ensure any filter is as performant as possible.
