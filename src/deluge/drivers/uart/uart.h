/*
 * ================= DEBUGGING TEXT OUTPUT =================
 *
 * To get some debugging text output from the Deluge, ideally you’ll be using a J-link,
 * and can then use its RTT utility. To tell the firmware build to include this text
 * generation and outputting, go to src/drivers/All_CPUs/uart_all_cpus/uart_all_cpus.h and
 * set ENABLE_TEXT_OUTPUT to 1. The fact that this flag is in a file labelled “uart” will seem
 * to make no sense because RTT output has nothing to do with UART. This is because before I
 * realised RTT was a thing, this flag would instead send the debugging text out of the MIDI DIN port,
 * and MIDI is UART. If you’re not using a J-link and want to see the debugging text,
 * this might be what you want to do. If so, go to src/drivers/RZA1/cpu_specific.h,
 * and set HAVE_RTT to 0. Though this configuration hasn’t been tested for a while...
