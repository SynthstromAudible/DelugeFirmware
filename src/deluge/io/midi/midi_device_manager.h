/*A ConnectedUSBMIDIDevice is used directly to interface with the USB driver
 * When a ConnectedUSBMIDIDevice has a numMessagesQueued>=MIDI_SEND_BUFFER_LEN and tries to add another,
 * all outputs are sent. The send routine calls the USB output function, points the
 * USB pipes FIFO buffer directly at the dataSendingNow array, and then sends.
 * Sends can also be triggered by the midiAndGateOutput interrupt
 *
 * Reads are more complicated.
 * Actual reads are done by usb_cstd_usb_task, which has a commented out interrupt associated
 * The function is instead called in the midiengine::checkincomingUSBmidi function, which is called
 * in the audio engine loop
 *
 * The USB read function is configured by setupUSBHostReceiveTransfer, which is called to
 * setup the next device after each successful read. Data is written directly into the receiveData
 * array from the USB device, it's set as the USB pipe address during midi engine setup
